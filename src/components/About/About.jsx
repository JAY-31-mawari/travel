        <h1>The Power of Technology: React, Node.js, and MySQL</h1>

        <p>Our website stands at the intersection of technology and wanderlust. We are built on the robust foundations of React, the JavaScript library that powers the dynamic and interactive user interface you see. Behind the scenes, our Node.js API fuels your travel dreams by connecting seamlessly to our MySQL database.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h1>Fetching the World: API and Endpoints</h1>

        <p>The heartbeat of Our Travel World is our sophisticated API, driven by Node.js, that fetches the latest travel details. Our endpoints - getdata, insertdata, and deletedata - form the connective tissue of our website. With getdata, we ensure you always receive the most up-to-date information. When it's time to add your travel stories to the mix, the insertdata endpoint comes to life. And when the journey is over, we use deletedata to keep our database clean.</p>
        <br></br>
